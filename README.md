# UAVisualization

Work in progress! Aims to be a generic tool for 3D visualization of flight
trajectories of UAVs. Initial functionality will be geared towards log data
review (realtime playback and 'scrubbing' as in digital audio/video). Vehicle
geometry will be configurable, with a certain amount of kinematics to allow for,
e.g., varying types of tilt-wing vehicles.
